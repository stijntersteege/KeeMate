# KeeMate
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/449e1cf4-de3e-4026-9a5d-aa10343cfea6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/keemate/deploys)

KeeMate allows you to generate extremely secure random passwords in just a few clicks. The application is built with Nuxt.js (based on Vue.js) using Tailwind CSS. No additional libraries were used.

KeeMate is one of the mini projects I built within 24 hours. Curious about my other projects? Take a look at my GitHub profile.

$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

# build for production and launch server
